## Why is it taking so long to find a fix?

There can be several reasons reasons for this.

**New location** - if you are at a new location after a long flight, the GPS on your phone can take a while to reorient itself. Try running GPSLogger at high frequency until it does find a location.

**Interference** - there may be structures nearby blocking your signal.

**Mid flight** - if you are in a commercial aircraft, you are probably traveling too fast for your phone's hardware to keep up with the GPS signals.
