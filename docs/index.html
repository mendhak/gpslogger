    <p class="description">A battery efficient GPS logging application</p>
    <section class="blurb">GPSLogger uses the GPS capabilities of your Android phone to log coordinates to GPS format files at regular intervals.
      This can be particularly useful if you want to geotag your photos after a day out or share your travel route with someone.
      The purpose of this application is to be battery efficient to save you battery power when abroad and last as long as
      possible.</section><a href="#quicktour" class="button">Tour</a> <a href="#frequentlyaskedquestionsandissues" class="button">FAQ</a> <a href="#morescreenshots" class="button">Screenshots</a>

<p><strong>New location</strong> - if you are at a new location after a long flight, the GPS on your phone can take a while to reorient itself. Try running GPSLogger at high frequency until it does find a location.</p>
<p><strong>Interference</strong> - there may be structures nearby blocking your signal.</p>
<p><strong>Mid flight</strong> - if you are in a commercial aircraft, you are probably traveling too fast for your phone&#39;s hardware to keep up with the GPS signals.</p>
<p>You can read more a little more on what&#39;s involved <a href="gps-fix-details.html">here</a></p>

</div></section>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="whyarethefixessometimesinaccurate" href="#whyarethefixessometimesinaccurate">Why are the fixes sometimes inaccurate?</a></h2><p>It all comes down to your hardware, settings and environment. The accuracy is only as good as your phone&#39;s GPS chip. Some phones may have 4 meter accuracies, some have 500 meters. Also, using GPS satellites will give you better accuracy but take a longer time; using network location will give worse accuracy but is quicker. You may also want to check your environment, as there can be inaccuracy due to clouds, buildings, sunspots, alien invasion, etc.</p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="mytimeintervalhaspassedbutnopointwaslogged" href="#mytimeintervalhaspassedbutnopointwaslogged">My time interval has passed, but no point was logged</a></h2><h2><a name="sometimestheappwillnotlogforlongperiodsoftime" href="#sometimestheappwillnotlogforlongperiodsoftime">Sometimes, the app will not log for long periods of time</a></h2><p>Sometimes your specified time interval will have passed, but no point was logged.  There are a few reasons this could happens. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>On Android 6+ (Marshmallow), a new feature called <em><a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-android-doze-works-and-how-to-tweak-it-to-save-you-1785921957">doze mode</a></em> was introduced, which severely restricts activity on the device after certain periods of inactivity. Be sure to grant the app permission to run in the background by disabling battery optimization.  If you aren&#39;t sure, or if you&#39;ve denied this permission you can <a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/a/129075/14996">disable battery optimization for GPSLogger manually</a> which does not bypass doze mode but occasionally provides logging windows in which to work. It will not make a great difference though, doze mode is quite aggressive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many vendors are also known to introduce their own <em>additional</em> poorly written but aggressive battery optimization mechanisms.  App developers don&#39;t have a way of detecting or working around these, and unfortunately the apps receive all the blame.  You can see some partial workarounds on the <a href="https://dontkillmyapp.com/?app=GPSLogger">Don&#39;t Kill My App site</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The GPS system will have attempted to find its location and given up after a while. This in turn means that Android OS will not have given a location to GPSLogger</p>
</li>
<li><p>The accuracy was below your <em>Accuracy filter</em> settings, or the distance was below your <em>Distance filter</em> settings, so GPSLogger didn&#39;t log it. You can try setting a <em>retry interval</em> in which GPSLogger can wait for a matching accurate point to show up and then use it.  Or you can allow for slightly more inaccurate fixes - your mileage may vary as every phone is different in terms of how accurate a fix it can get on a regular basis. </p>
</li>
<li><p>On Android 8+ (Oreo), the LocationManager has been limited: <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background-location-limits">&quot;Location updates are provided to background apps only a few times each hour.&quot;</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>summary</strong>, to try to maximize the locations you can receive, be sure to do the following:   </p>
<ol>
<li>Grant all location permissions to the app.  This includes the background (&quot;Allow all the time&quot;) permission.</li>
<li><a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/a/129075/14996">Disable battery optimization</a> for GPSLogger</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://dontkillmyapp.com/?app=GPSLogger">Don&#39;t Kill My App site</a> website</li>
<li>Keep the app in the foreground before locking the screen </li>
</ol>

<p>When logging to file, the units are always in <strong>SI units</strong> - meters and seconds.</p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="whereisthefilebeingloggedhowdoigettoit" href="#whereisthefilebeingloggedhowdoigettoit">Where is the file being logged? How do I get to it?</a></h2><h2><a name="whatisthedefaultfolderpath" href="#whatisthedefaultfolderpath">What is the default folder path?</a></h2><p>Due to recent restrictions, the default GPSLogger folder is different per device. You can see it on the simple/detailed screens and it may be something like </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>/sdcard/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial part will be different for your device. </p>
<p>If you have a file explorer installed, you can click on the folder paths in the simple/detailed screens.</p>
<p>To copy the GPSLogger files, you can connect your phone to your computer and mount the SD card, then copy straight from the above folder. You can also change the default folder in the app settings. </p>
<p>Finally, note that due to the <a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/09/storage-situation-removable-storage.html">restrictions introduced in Android KitKat</a>, any files in the default folder will be removed if you uninstall the app.</p>
<h2><a name="howtologtoanexternalsdcard" href="#howtologtoanexternalsdcard">How to log to an external SD card?</a></h2><p>Under logging details, pick the &#39;save to folder&#39; dialog. You will need to use your SD card&#39;s serial number in the path - a file manager should be able to reveal this to you.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/storage/1b04-100a/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also try:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/storage/1b04-100a/Download/gpslogger</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/storage/1b04-100a/DCIM/gpslogger</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that GPSLogger can only write to its application folders.  Download and DCIM may be writeable, the app will warn you if it is not writeable.  File explorers are able to write to any location but they make use of a special media hack which this app cannot rely on. </p>

This means that if you&#39;ve set your interval as 1 hour, you have a long wait ahead of you. If you want the changes to take effect immediately, then stop logging and start it again so that the changes are refreshed.</p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="whatdothevarioussettingsmeanaccuracyretryintervalforaccuracyetc" href="#whatdothevarioussettingsmeanaccuracyretryintervalforaccuracyetc">What do the various settings mean? (Accuracy, retry interval for accuracy, etc)</a></h2><p><img src="images/7b.png" alt="7b"></p>
<p><strong>Logging interval</strong> - How long to wait after a point has been logged to try logging again.</p>
<p><strong>Distance filter</strong> - When a point becomes available, the app will check to ensure that this much distance exists between the previous and current points. If it isn&#39;t this distance, the point is discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy filter</strong> - When a point becomes available, the app will check to ensure that this point has a minimum accuracy specified. If it does not match the specified accuracy, the point is discarded. This is useful if you are inside a building for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Duration to match accuracy</strong> - When searching for a point, the app can continue searching for this many seconds until it finds a point that meets the accuracy and distance filter criteria above.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute timeout</strong> - When searching for a point and trying over and over, the app will give up when this timeout is reached.  This is useful for when you&#39;re inside buildings, GPS tends to keep searching and finding nothing.  </p>
<p><strong>Keep GPS on between fixes</strong> - Normally, the app stops using GPS between points, to save battery.  This means when it&#39;s time to log the next point, the GPS needs to be &#39;woken up&#39; again and this takes a little time.  Keeping GPS on between fixes causes this &#39;wake up&#39; time to be reduced.</p>

<p>If you turn mobile data off, you&#39;ll probably want to inject aGPS data regularly, there are apps that can do it for you. You can also try going into airplane mode which turns many things off. </p>
<p>When it comes to choosing between <em>location sources</em> - GPS vs network - GPS will be more battery hungry, but has better accuracy; network location is easier on the battery but isn&#39;t as accurate.</p>
<p>For <em>time intervals</em>, consider using 60 seconds or more.</p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="theappdoesntlogatexactlyemxemsecondsasivespecified" href="#theappdoesntlogatexactlyemxemsecondsasivespecified">The app doesn&#39;t log at exactly <em>x</em> seconds as I&#39;ve specified</a></h2><p>It&#39;s how the Android OS has implemented its GPS system. When you say you want a point every 60 seconds (for example), that&#39;s actually a suggestion rather than an imperative, and so the time interval between GPS points is never guaranteed. GPSLogger has logic that checks the time difference, though, and will make sure that at least 60 seconds have passed before logging again.  It is not meant for sub-second logging, as that will require aggressive wakelocks.</p>

<p>As of newer versions of Android, removing the notification will cause the service to be killed. As a result, the notification now needs to stay there. You may have seen a recent increase in the number of apps that need to sit in the notification bar for the same reason - to perform background services without being killed.  </p>
<p>There is an option in the app&#39;s settings that allows you to remove the notification buttons if you want a smaller notification.  </p>

<p>Due to the varied nature of the way task managers and task killers work, I simply cannot help or advise with any problems where you have one of these installed, and <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/166140/you-dont-need-to-install-a-task-manager-how-to-manage-running-apps-on-android/">would advise against it as well</a></p>

A lot of other apps, such as MyTracks, usually go with the assumption that you have a data connection available and your routes won&#39;t be very long. They use CPU wakelocks and log points extremely frequently with high accuracy. The aim of GPSLogger is to log points and stay quiet.  </p>
<p>To put it another way, MyTracks or similar are better suited for runs; GPSLogger is suited for days out, hiking, photography.</p>

<p>A common use case is to geotag photos.  Many cameras, especially SLRs, don&#39;t have built-in GPS.  After a day (or days) out of photography, you may have hundreds of photos that need to be geotagged so that their locations can appear properly when used elsewhere.  </p>

<p>You can copy this file or export it via the main share menu. </p>
<p>Also note - the current profile&#39;s settings are automatically saved whenever you switch between profiles.</p>
<h3><a name="creatingaprofilemanually" href="#creatingaprofilemanually">Creating a profile manually</a></h3><p>You can create your own <code>.properties</code> file and put your key value pairs in it. </p>
<p>For example, in the file you can put <code>accuracy_before_logging=42</code> and that will reset the <em>Accuracy Filter</em> to 42 meters each time the application starts. There are many properties that can be applied and you can glean a <a href="https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/blob/master/gpslogger/src/main/java/com/mendhak/gpslogger/common/PreferenceNames.java">full list here</a>.</p>
<p>The most common examples of properties would be <code>log_gpx</code>, <code>log_kml</code>, <code>time_before_logging</code>, <code>opengts_*</code> for OpenGTS settings, <code>smtp_*</code> for email settings.</p>

<p> You can also load a profile in GPSLogger by clicking a link on a web page.  This is also an easy way to provide your users or yourself with a preset profile - all they need to do is click a link on a page, no typing or pasting.</p>
<p> Create a <code>.properties</code> file with your settings in it - see <a href="#saveyourcurrentsettingsasaprofile">instructions</a>.  Host it at an accessible URL, self signed URLs will not work here.</p>
<p> You will then need to host a web page with a hyperlink to that file in it, with this structure. </p>
<pre><code> &lt;a href=&quot;gpslogger://properties/https://www.mendhak.com/test.properties&quot;&gt;Download this profile&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre><p>Basically <code>gpslogger://properties/</code> followed by the actual URL of your <code>.properties</code> file. </p>
<p>Due to deficiencies in the Chrome browser, this needs to be a hyperlink on a webpage.  The link must be clicked in a browser (Firefox, Chrome) on their Android device.     </p>

<p>You can load a profile with your settings from a URL.  This is also an easy way of providing your users or yourself with a preset profile. </p>
<p>Create a <code>.properties</code> file with your settings in it - see <a href="#saveyourcurrentsettingsasaprofile">instructions</a>.  Host it at an accessible URL, self signed URLs will not work here.</p>
<p>To load the profile from the app, press the &#39;Default Profile&#39;, which switches to the profile menu, then choose &#39;From URL&#39;. In the dialog, give the URL of a properties file. GPSLogger will attempt to download the file, switch to it as a profile and apply the properties.</p>

<p>You can also share profiles using a file on the device.  </p>
<p>If you create a file in the GPSLogger default directory, a profile will appear in the menu named after the file.  For example, <code>xyz.properties</code> will appear as <code>xyz</code>. </p>
<h4>Special profile - <code>gpslogger.properties</code></h4>

<p>If you create a file in the GPSLogger default folder or specifically at <code>/sdcard/gpslogger.properties</code>, then GPSLogger will read this file each time it loads and apply those settings to the application, overriding whatever settings you have currently. </p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="troubleshooting" href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2><p>Sometimes the app might not behave in an expected way.  </p>
<p>You can troubleshoot it yourself by going to <em>General Options</em> and enabling the <em>Write to debug file</em> option.  </p>
<p>Next, reproduce the behavior or problem, and this creates a <code>debuglog.txt</code> file in the GPSLogger folder.  </p>
<p>You can then grab the file off your phone and have a look through it, or email it to yourself from the same screen (<em>Attach debug log to email</em>).  Be sure to turn it off afterwards as this file grows very fast.   </p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="customsslcertificates" href="#customsslcertificates">Custom SSL Certificates</a></h2><p><img src="images/21sslvalidation.gif" alt="SSLValidation"></p>
<p>If you use <strong>self signed certificates</strong> or <strong>custom CA certificates</strong> in Custom URL, OwnCloud, OpenGTS, FTP or SMTP then you will need to get GPSLogger to recognize and store your custom certificates.    </p>
<p>It&#39;s easy.  Just go into a setting screen where you have specified a custom SSL URL or server, and click <code>Validate SSL Certificate</code>.  You will be prompted with the certificate&#39;s details, you can then choose to accept; the certificate will be stored in the local keystore.  </p>
<p>This validation is required as it&#39;s a security best practice. It helps protect your information between your device and the server, it prevents attackers from listening in.  The Google Play Store is also asking developers to be stricter with SSL based verifications.</p>
<p>In the case of OwnCloud, OpenGTS and Custom URL, the certificate must match the domain you&#39;re connecting to.   In other words, if your certificate is issued to <code>example.com</code> then the URL you are connecting to must match <code>example.com</code>. More specifically this means that the certificate <em>Common Name</em> or <em>Subject Alternative Name</em> must match the host of the URL you are connecting to. </p>

GPS receivers receive their signals over multiple paths.  The main path of course is the satellites themselves, but it also receives signals due to reflection off those nearby objects.  The receiver now sees more signal sources than are actually present and based on various algorithms, chooses to believe one of them.  Due to the reflected signals, the distance and clock offset from the satellite also differs and the calculation based on this is now slightly incorrect.  Considering that there may be several satellite signals being reflected, the overall outcome is the GPS drift that you see. </p>
<p>To deal with this you can use the distance filter in the performance settings.    </p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="whydothelogfilessometimeshavemissingdatafields" href="#whydothelogfilessometimeshavemissingdatafields">Why do the log files sometimes have missing data fields?</a></h2><h2><a name="whyisthealtitudevaluemissing" href="#whyisthealtitudevaluemissing">Why is the altitude value missing?</a></h2><p>A few fields such as <code>pdop</code>, <code>hdop</code>, <code>vdop</code>, <code>geoidheight</code>, <code>ageodfgpsdata</code>, <code>dgpsid</code> may not always appear in the logs produced.  This is because they are read from the NMEA listener which is different from the actual GPS/GNSS listener provided by Android OS.  Because they are not read simultaneously there can be periods where the NMEA listener reports nothing while GPS/GNSS continues as normal.  In those cases, no additional data is available. </p>
<p>The altitude value may also go missing if you have MSL checked.  This feature subtracts the <code>geoidheight</code> from the reported altitude.  In cases where <code>geoidheight</code> is not available, the logic is to not report altitude at all, rather than report an incorrect value.  </p>

As part of <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Inclusion_Policy/">F-Droid&#39;s Inclusion Policy</a>, proprietary libraries are not allowed, only open source libraries are allowed.  This meant that the Activity Recognition feature and the Google Drive feature had to be removed from the app.    </p>
<p>While it may be possible to reimplement a Google Drive upload in the future, the Activity Recognition is unlikely to ever happen, unless an open source library for it gets created.  </p>
<p>There may still be references to these features in screenshots, FAQ and dialogs.  Please ignore those for now. </p>

<section><div class='lead'><h2><a name="loggingtosmsoremail" href="#loggingtosmsoremail">Logging to SMS or email</a></h2><p>Logging to SMS (and email) is a frequently requested feature, however this has not been implemented for a few reasons. While logging can be set to be frequent (~1 second), sending an email or SMS every second would get this app banned very quickly and is also likely unsafe for the user. </p>
<p>Although this <em>could</em> be mitigated by implementing specific logic to not allow SMS and emails to be sent so frequently, this would dramatically increase the complexity of the code and the flow of logic.  </p>
