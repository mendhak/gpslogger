* On Android 10+, the permission workflow will now ask for "allow all the time" permission
* The permission workflow will also request disabling battery optimization

* Adaptive icons, thanks to @kanru
* Added an option to reset the app (deletes all files and permissions for the app), in General settings
* Updated translations from Crowdin
